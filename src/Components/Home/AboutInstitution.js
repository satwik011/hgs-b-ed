                                            SOS Children’s Village of India is an independent, non- governmental, social development organization that provides family based care for children. The first SOS Children’s Village of India was founded by Hermann Gmiener in 1949 in Imst, Austria. He was committed to helping children in need, children who had lost their homes, their society and their families as a result of the Second World War. More than 7000 children and young people attend SOS Hermann Gmeiner Schools, SOS Kindergartens and SOS Vocational Training Centers. Moreover SOS Children’s Villages provides families with material, psychological and social support. In times of crisis and disaster, SOS Children’s Villages helps through emergency relief programes. SOS Children's Village Bhimtal was built on the former property of a Maharaja, around 300 km north of New Delhi, in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains.

                                            J. N. Kaul institute of Education, Bhimtal is a Community project of SOS Children’s Village of India. The Institute came into existence by the sincere and praiseworthy efforts of Padamshree Shri J. N. Kaul, President SOS Children’s Village of India in the year 2004. It is approved by NCTE and is affiliated to Kumaun University, Nainital. The University has been awarded grade ‘A’ by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). Since there was no B.Ed. College anywhere in the adjoining areas so as a need to fulfill the requirements of students who wish to opt for teaching as a profession & career, J. N. Kaul Institute of education was opened in 2005.
