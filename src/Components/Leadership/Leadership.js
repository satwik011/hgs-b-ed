As President of SOS Children’s Villages of India, I wish to provide the best possible learning experience to the future leaders of our country, so that all children are able to reach their maximum potential and achieve their dreams. Students end up spending most of their childhood within classrooms, so it is essential that within those walls they are imparted proper theoretical knowledge, practical aptitude, communal values, essential life skills, and an understanding of how the world works and their place in it. , "Adequate grooming and learning of children at a young age leads to them being strong, confident, hard-working and intelligent individuals, attributes that I deem necessary for the new era of technology and scientific progress we are heading towards."

                            In the modern concept of schooling, teaching has become redundant, paving the way for the facilitation of learning through knowledge sharing. The wave of digital learning and cloud computing is reaching new heights.
                            In all this whirlwind of new-age technology, it is important to charge ahead but with one’s head firmly on one’s shoulders. HGS strives to inculcate moral values, manners, responsibilities among students so that they may build a world free of all the evils.
                            Students here are encouraged to dream, groomed to give wings to their dreams, to take off and explore the unexplored. The plethora of interesting & exciting opportunities available to youngsters today often leave them with an array of things to do.
                            It is important therefore to help them build their focus on the subject that draws them most and gives shape to their vision. A student is made to blossom intellectually, morally, and spiritually. As Swami Vivekananda said, “Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life – think of it, dream of it, and live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.”
